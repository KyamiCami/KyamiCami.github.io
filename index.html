    NASCAR stands for the National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing. It is one of the most popular auto racing series, just behind the Formula One racing series. It is best known for its three national series, which are: Gander Outdoors Series (truck-like cars), Xfinity Series and Monster Energy series, the most popular being the Monster Energy series. NASCAR sanctions over 1,500 races at over 100 tracks in 48 US states as well as in Canada, Mexico, and Europe. Itâ€™s most competitive category, Monster Energy, hosts 36 races in the span of 10-months.

    Although NASCAR may seem boring, as in the sense of just watching cars going in circles, simply turning left in every corner, that's really just a <strong> myth </strong>. The bright colors of the cars, the sounds of the engines and the screaming fans, the smell of brake dust and rubber on the track, the taste of a cold beverage on a smoking hot day spent in the sun with family and friends, feeling the rumble in your seat as you watch the race cars fly past, the shouting and thuds you hear when a group of cars crash altogether. It's something one says: 'Wow. I want to feel that adrenaline rush again.'
