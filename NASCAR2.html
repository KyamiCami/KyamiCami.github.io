<h1> How Does NASCAR Work? </h1>

<h2> Point System and Races </h2>
NASCAR season lasts from Febuary all the way to November, every weekend having a race for fans to watch from all three series (with the exception for holidays). Which each win or top-10 placements in each race, they accumulate points, in which when approaching the end of the season, the top 16 drivers with the most points qualify in the "Round of 16". From there, those 16 drivers compete to gain points and try to be in the top 8 so that they could qualify to the "Round of 8". Same thing applies, then going to the "Round of 6", then the "Final 4". The final 4 drivers with the most points/wins are then off to the final race and whomever wins the race/gets the highest placing in the race wins the championship and will be titles as the champion.

<h2> Pit Crew and Regulations </h2>
<p>
The three main 'roles' there is in a pit crew team are: Crew Chief, Spotter and Pit Crew (in which in this category, there are smaller roles, but for now, we'll consider them as one).
</p>
<p>
To begin, there is the crew chief. They serve as the head captain of the team and instructs on what everyone should do. As an example, he will be the one to tell the driver whether or not he sould come to their pit lane (where they fix their car) and to fix the car even though they might lose position. Even outside of race time, they continue to act as the leader, by instructing on what parts should be fixed, what things should be added to the car, etc. Even though they do have an important role in the team, they <strong> CAN </strong> be taken out of the race. This usually happens when the car fails inspection and has something that can affect its speed or movement.
